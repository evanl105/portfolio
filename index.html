                        <p>We developed a quantum-based approach to accelerate complex integer arithmetic, aiming to save researchers and companies significant time on large-scale computations. By implementing core arithmetic operations using qubits, our prototype demonstrates the potential for quantum computing to outperform classical methods and free up resources for higher-level tasks. Our work highlights how even small speedups can lead to major long-term efficiency gains as datasets and computational demands grow.</p>
